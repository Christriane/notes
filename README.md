# Notes App
Developed as part of a project from Andrew Mead's Meteor/React.js Course on Udemy.

Notes is a simple web application that allows the user to create an account to write down a note. It allows the user to delete that note when it's no longer needed. 

## Getting Started

NOTE: This app requires you to have Meteor installed on your machine.

Afterwords, run the following to get setup:

```
git clone https://github.com/Christriane/notes.git
cd notes
meteor npm install
meteor
```

## Running the Tests

Running the tests is simple. All you need to do is run the following command and view the web reporter at localhost port 3000.

```
npm test
```

## Tech Used:
